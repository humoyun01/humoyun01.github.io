<h3>Deadpool </h3>
<p>Untitled Deadpool Sequel, commonly known as Deadpool 2, is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Deadpool, distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is intended to be the twelfth installment in the X-Men film series, and a sequel to the 2016 film Deadpool. The film is being directed by David Leitch from a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, with Ryan Reynolds starring in the title role alongside Morena Baccarin, T. J. Miller, Leslie Uggams, Brianna Hildebrand, Stefan Kapičić, Zazie Beetz, Josh Brolin, and Jack Kesy.

Plans for a sequel to Deadpool began before that film's release, and were confirmed in February 2016. Though the original creative team of Reynolds, Reese, Wernick, and director Tim Miller were quickly set to return for the second film, Miller left the project in October 2016 due to creative differences with Reynolds, and was soon replaced by Leitch. Drew Goddard had also been in contention to direct, and joined the film to consult on the script in early 2017. An extensive casting search to fill the role of Cable took place, with Brolin ultimately cast in the role. Filming took place in British Columbia, Canada, from June to October 2017. During filming, stunt woman Joi "SJ" Harris died in a motorcycle accident.

Untitled Deadpool Sequel is scheduled to be released on June 1, 2018.</p>

<h3>Spider Men </h3>
<p>Spider man Homecoming

The second trailer for Spider Man Homecoming just dropped. Here’s what the trailer tells us about Spidey’s upcoming cinematic venture:

Enter the Spidey Smart Suit

Spiderman has a new suit that’s been specially designed by Tony Stark. We already saw the suit in action during Civil War, and here we see greater details about how it works (basically, you press a button), and how long it stays in Peter Parker’s possession (not very long). We’re getting to see a different version of the Spidey Suit this time around that shares certain similarities to Iron Man’s robotic armor.</p>
